# Medical History Integration System – 3-Week Development Roadmap

**Goal:**  
Developing a **role-based medical history management system** with:  
- Role-based login (Doctor and Lab(Hospitals and clinics), Pharmacy, Admin, Patient)  
- Patient medical history  
- Permission code system for patient data access  
- Basic authentication
- Demo presentation at the end of 3 weeks

---

## Team Structure

- **Frontend Team**: React + Tailwind (Web Dashboard)
    > Mainly Yohannes habtamu and Saron Miruts

- **Backend Team **: Node.js or Django + PostgreSQL (API, Auth, CRUD)
    > Mainly Mentesinot getu and Chala Hiko
- **Integration**: Every 2–3 days  
- **Testing**: Every 4 days

- [ ] Integration & Testing #2
- [ ] Code refactor & cleanup

**Milestone:**  
 Full patient workflow: **Login → Search → Add/View History → Permission Check**
